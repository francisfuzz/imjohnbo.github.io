[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a first class citizen on GitHub used for workflow automation of all kinds. If you're new to this feature, let me point you to these fantastic write-ups ✨:
- <a href="https://jeffrafter.com/working-with-github-actions/">https://jeffrafter.com/working-with-github-actions/</a>
- <a href="https://jasonet.co/posts/new-features-of-github-actions/">https://jasonet.co/posts/new-features-of-github-actions/</a>

## Background
Ok, now you're an Actions expert. You know about the CI/CD primitives, the [secret store](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets), and how [thousands of actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) and hundreds of thousands of workflows have already been built. For example, this workflow will kick off integration tests when a pull request is opened and publish it to npm when the pull request is merged into the `main` branch:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/imjohnbo/174efe3f93dd0e51fd0a9e55f7c025ab.js"></script>

## Problem
And you have a keen eye. You and [some other eagle eyes](https://dev.to/derberg/github-actions-when-fascination-turns-into-disappointment-4d75) have noticed that **there is one hang-up with _forks_**: they don't play well with secrets! When your open source project gets a pull request from a fork, and you kick off the workflow above ☝️, the publish fails [because the secret isn't available](https://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/github_actions_11_secrets.html#:~:text=Forks,that%20originate%20from%20a%20fork.). This is intentional for security reasons.

## Workaround
But wait, **there is a workaround**: <a href="https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test">https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test</a>! Imagine typing a slash command `/ok-to-test` as a pull request comment after looking over the incoming proposal, which kicks off the workflow above _with secrets_. No more publishing failure! This workaround uses a wee `repository_dispatch` event and leverages a few very handy community actions.

Check out the [repository](https://github.com/imjohnbo/ok-to-test) for all the details, and let me know what you think there.

Happy pull requesting!
