If you use macOS Terminal on a daily basis like I do, try out these time-saving tips.

## 1️⃣ Adjust your keyboard "Key Repeat" and "Delay Until Repeat" speed. 

This will _massively_ decrease the time it takes you to erase long lines of text! Not that you'd ever make mistakes. Find this setting under System Preferences ➡️ Keyboard.

## 2️⃣ Option + click anywhere!

I can't believe how long I went without learning this.

## 3️⃣ Command + k to clear

Because sometimes typing `clear` is just too much.
